# Intro

1.  Fill out *Help us get to know you* survey on Canvas

2.  Listen to *only* timestap 26:27 to 31:22 (basically 5 minutes) of the following blog by Lisa Felman Barrett - a highly cited psychologist

    -   [blog 26:27 to 31:22](https://youtu.be/NbdRIVCBqNI?t=1587)

    -   if you are interested you can learn [More about Lisa Felman Barrett](https://www.affective-science.org/lisa-feldman-barrett.shtml)

    -   Think about what an inverse inference problem might be in the context of the environment

3.  In this course, we will work a lot with writing and applying functions; You've all been exposed to writing functions in previous courses - but just to make sure that everyone remembers the basic syntax in R, complete the following:

Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation. You can use the following formula:

The energy produced by a solar panel system is given by

$$
E = A \cdot r \cdot H \cdot PR
$$

where:

-   $E$ is the energy produced (kWh),
-   $A$ is the solar panel area (m$^2$),
-   $r$ is the panel yield (dimensionless, 0–1), representing manufacturer efficiency (typically $\sim 0.2$),
-   $PR$ is the performance ratio (dimensionless, 0–1), accounting for site-specific losses (typically $\sim 0.75$),
-   $H$ is the annual average solar radiation (kWh m$^{-2}$).

Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for *r* and *PR* in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canvas.

```{r}
#' Photovoltaic Energy
#' 
#' Computes the energy produced from a photovoltaic system given the average annual solar radiation.
#'
#' @param A number indicating the solar panel area (m2)
#' @param H number indicating the annual average solar radiation (kWh m-2)
#' @param r number indicating the panel yield (dimensionless, 0-1), representing manufacturer efficiency (typically ~ 0.2)
#' @param PR number indicating the performance ratio (dimensionless, 0-1), accounting for site-specific losses (typically ~0.75)
#'
#' @return Energy produced (kWh)
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' photovoltaic_energy(A = 20, H = 1000)
#' photovoltaic_energy(A = 20, H = 1000, r = 0.3, PR = 0.8)
photovoltaic_energy <- function(A, H, r = 0.2, PR = 0.75) {
  E <- A * r * H * PR
  return(E)
}
```

### To summarize, submit the following by 8am Jan 8:

1.  Fill out 'get to know you' survey on Canvas\
2.  A single R file that implements the solar energy yield function (on Canvas)

You don't need to submit anything for the Lisa Felman Barrett blog - just think about the inverse inference problem in the context of the environment. We will discuss next class
